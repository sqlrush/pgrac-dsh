#    CI helper: static census of wal-state registry correctness
#    reader/writer call sites (RF-ROOT P7 G4 / STOP-01 §17.9).
#
#    Post-bit22 (PGRAC_CONTROL_ROOT_FEATURE_RECOVERY_DUTY_IDENTITY_V1),
#    EVERY wal-state correctness reader/writer must be statically
#    unreachable — the canonical control root carries the checkpoint/tail/
#    FPW bounds (CHECKPOINT_ADVANCE + FPW_STICKY publications), and the
#    registry is telemetry only.
#
#    Batch 3 / 增量 39 §C / 补记 43-44: the census is the POST-bit22 static
#    proof (gate modeling), NOT a pre-bit22 precondition.  The frozen
#    §17.8 keeps the registry as the SELECTED authority before bit22 opens,
#    so pre-bit22 registry reads are legal.  The modeling object is
#    "no UNGATED correctness call site":
#
#      - GATE-BOUND sites: their registry reads sit inside the recognized
#        gate idiom `cluster_r4_bit22_cutover_active()` — legal pre-bit22
#        and statically unreachable post-bit22 (the latch is monotonic), so
#        the census does NOT count them; each file must still contain the
#        idiom anchor (drift check below).
#      - KNOWN-DEFERRED sites: ungated registry reads that stay
#        §17.8-correct until the bit22 cutover round closes them in the
#        same commit.  strict mode counts them (RED = the post-bit22 proof
#        is not established yet); the runtime latch apply refuses to flip
#        while they are listed (same table, lockstep).
#      - the TELEMETRY-ONLY whitelist (allowed forever):
#        W1-W5 writers, xlogrecovery raw_ignored LOG, the R4 migration
#        binding (merge_recovered_lsn == 0 source-zero evidence).
#
#    The default (strict) mode is the post-bit22 proof gate: GREEN = every
#    correctness call site is telemetry, GATE-BOUND behind the idiom, or
#    closed.  `--deferred-ok` prints (not fails) the GATE-BOUND/KNOWN-
#    DEFERRED sites for the cutover audit.
