# t/274_rfroot_bit22_cutover_restart.pl -- RF-ROOT P9 审计 #2 重做 (DSH
# 2026-08-19): the REAL online bit22 cutover on the 2-node shared-root
# substrate (no offline fixture cast), then restart legs.
#
#   L1  formation ACTIVE
#   L2  coordinator accepts pgrac_r4_bit22_cutover_begin()
#   L3  round reaches OPEN: canonical root ACTIVE (activation_state=2),
#       registry correctness stays telemetry-only (no CF-gated mutation)
#   L4  clean restart of the peer keeps the cluster serving and the root
#       ACTIVE (post-bit22 gate re-arms from the durable OPEN record)
#   L5  clean restart of the coordinator likewise
#
# The source-close BARRIER (增量 61) freezes every member's wal-state
# writers first, so ACTIVE slots are provably quiesced migration input --
# no STOPPED requirement, no fixture authority.
