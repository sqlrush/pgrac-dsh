# 271_wal_first_recoverer_fresh.pl
#    RF-ROOT P9 RL-01 (faithful fault leg): first-recoverer freshness.
#    One origin fails; the survivor's first recovery must enter from
#    canonical sources (shared root / WAL / membership / fence) with NO
#    private adoption, and only completed resources open.
#
#    Leg shape (2-node, no node restart — the death legs RL-02..04 are
#    honestly SKIP-with-reason: the replay actor never reaches mutation
#    under fence provider-0, per 增量 51):
#
#      L1  pair forms; node1 writes WAL (durable registry slot 2)
#      L2  node1 CHECKPOINT + stop('immediate') — real node death
#      L3  survivor (node0) detects DEAD + runs the recovery flow:
#          HW remaster rebuilds from the canonical snapshot
#          ("rebuilt authority from dead node 1 (snapshot ...,
#          validated end ...) -> done") — the R3/R5 canonical rebuild,
#          never an adoption of any previous recoverer's private progress
#      L4  ASSERT thread-recovery (the replay actor) did NOT execute:
#          under fence provider-0 the actor stops BLOCKED at
#          NeedSet/admit with zero GES/replay/publish — "only completed
#          resources open" (the HW authority rebuilt; nothing else)
#      L5  node1 crash-rejoins (t243 L4 path); pair reforms
#
#    Scope note (4.7 / 增量 40-41 §A, same as t243): no table access
#    around the peer death; assertions read logs only; node1 rejoin uses
#    the t243 L4 fast-restart window (<3s) so the survivor's death
#    detection never races the epoch bump.
