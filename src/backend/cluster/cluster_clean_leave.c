 *
 * cluster_clean_leave.c
 *	  pgrac clean leave reconfiguration (spec-5.13) — runtime driver.
 *
 *	  Runtime half of the clean-leave module: the shmem ClusterLeaveState,
 *	  the leaving-node phase state machine (cluster_clean_leave_request +
 *	  _drive_drain), the ProcSignal quiesce path, the voting-disk leave-intent
 *	  marker two-phase commit (qvotec-mediated), the IC announce/ack/commit-ready
 *	  glue, and the LMON orchestration (cluster_clean_leave_lmon_tick: leaving-node
 *	  barrier + survivor drop/ack + coordinator two-phase commit).  The pure
 *	  decisions it feeds on live in cluster_clean_leave_policy.c.
 *
 *	  Execution model (Option A): the leaving node self-drives the drain in its
 *	  OWN backend (REQUESTED -> QUIESCE -> GES drain -> GCS flush -> PCM release ->
 *	  BARRIER_WAIT; the flush is in a backend, never LMON, CL-I9), then the LMON
 *	  collects survivor ACKs and asks the survivor coordinator (min node id) to
 *	  bump the epoch (LEAVE_COMMIT_READY).  Still pending: CL-I12 touched
 *	  drain-grace dispatch + the CL-I5 block-serve gate call-site (spec-5.13 S6),
 *	  the SRF/UDF/inject/catversion surface (S7), and the 2-node TAP e2e (S8).

 *	runs REQUESTED -> QUIESCE -> GES drain -> GCS flush -> PCM release ->
 *	BARRIER_WAIT synchronously, so the force-WAL-log + FlushBuffer runs in a real
 *	backend (CL-I9, never in LMON), then returns.  The leaving-node LMON tick then
 *	collects survivor ACKs and sends LEAVE_COMMIT_READY to the survivor
 *	coordinator (min node id), which owns the epoch bump (Q6-A): the coordinator's
 *	LMON runs the §3.1 two-phase commit (COMMITTING marker -> bump+publish
 *	CLEAN_LEAVE -> COMMITTED marker).  The new epoch propagates back; the leaving
 *	node observes its CLEAN_LEAVE event and reaches COMMITTED.
 *
 *	NOTE (review): the readiness handoff (LEAVE_COMMIT_READY) is the impl
 *	mechanism for the spec's under-specified commit trigger; the spec pins the
 *	decision (leaving self-drives, survivor coordinator commits, flush-before-
 *	commit for CL-I5) but not the trigger wire.  Flagged for the mandated opus
 *	review (DoD).  CL-I12 touched drain-grace dispatch + the CL-I5 block-serve
