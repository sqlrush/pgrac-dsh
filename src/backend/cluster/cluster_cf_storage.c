 * cluster_cf_storage.c
 *	  Establish and verify the shared pg_control authority on a node and
 *	  on the underlying shared storage (spec-5.6).
 *
 *	  Covers migration of a per-node control file into the shared
 *	  authority plus a node-local symlink, classification of what a
 *	  node's local control path actually is, the Phase-1 local rename
 *	  probe, and the pure write-gate.  Phase-2 cross-node nonce+
 *	  ack verification (which needs the interconnect and a live peer) is
 *	  layered on by the bootstrap path and exercised by t/289.
