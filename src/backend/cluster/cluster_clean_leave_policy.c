 *	  pgrac clean leave reconfiguration (spec-5.13) — pure decision layer.
 *
 *	  Every function here is pure: it decides a phase-FSM transition, a
 *	  quiesce gate, a version-coherence check, or validates a leave-intent
 *	  marker, with no PostgreSQL runtime dependency (no shmem, no locks, no
 *	  voting-disk I/O, no ereport).  That keeps the correctness-critical
 *	  decisions (CL-I3 version-coherent, CL-I6 writable-only, marker trust)
 *	  exercisable directly by cluster_unit (test_cluster_clean_leave).
 *
 *	  The runtime layer (cluster_clean_leave.c) snapshots the live facts
 *	  (epoch, dead_generation, transaction state, on-disk marker) and feeds
 *	  them here, then acts on the verdict.

 *
 * History of the two inference failure modes this replaces:
 *   - r2 P2-1 (mis-latch wedge): the pre-r2 "epoch advanced + others-dead

 *     bitmap, suppressing the deadline escalation forever.

 *     conjunct is monotone the other way — a third-party transient flap on
 *     the leaver's local CSSD view advances it forever, so a healthy
 *     committed leave was refused until the deadline escalated it.
 * Marker evidence is immune to both: a refused leave never gets a COMMITTED
 * marker (no latch -> bounded deadline escalation), and a flap cannot make
 * durable evidence disappear (latch -> no false escalation).
 *
 * others_dead_unchanged / dead_gen_unchanged are the leaver's live coherence
 * observations.  They are deliberately kept in the signature as contract
 * inputs that MUST NOT affect the verdict — the U3b unit matrix pins the
 * flap-immunity on them — and the runtime uses them only for the flap-noise
