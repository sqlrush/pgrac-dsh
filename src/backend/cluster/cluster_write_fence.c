 *
 *	  The "pgrac cluster write fence" shmem region holds the local write-fence
 *	  token: the authorized_epoch + lease + self_fenced bit that qvotec (D2)
 *	  refreshes every poll from the durable voting-disk fence marker.  The hot
 *	  shared-storage write paths (D5) call cluster_write_fence_allowed() -- a
 *	  pure-read, no-throw, critical-section-safe check (no LWLock, no durable
 *	  I/O) -- and fail closed by context (ERROR / PANIC / BLOCKED) when this node
 *	  is stale / superseded / lease-expired / self-fenced.
