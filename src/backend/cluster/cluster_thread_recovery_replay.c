 *
 * cluster_thread_recovery_replay.c
 *	  pgrac online thread-recovery RMW replay engine (spec-4.11 D1, increment 3a).
 *
 *	  A survivor online-replays a dead WAL thread's data to shared storage within
 *	  the reconfig freeze window.  This engine streams the dead thread's WAL and,
 *	  for every block reference to a genuinely shared user-relation page, does a
 *	  read-modify-write directly against shared storage -- bypassing the buffer
 *	  pool.  Bypassing is safe because the dead thread's pages are fenced for the
 *	  freeze window: there is no concurrent access (the coherence precondition).
 *
 *	  This is crash-recovery redo, scoped to ONE thread's WAL, applied to shared
 *	  storage, with PG redo's global side effects stripped (the D0 STOP GATE A
 *	  reason ApplyWalRecord is not online-safe for a foreign segment's records:
 *	  it would advance the live survivor's global nextXid with a foreign xid).
 *	  The base for each apply is the LIVE shared page (not a clean FPI-base
 *	  reconstruction like spec-4.10); the record-end-vs-page LSN gate inside
 *	  cluster_thread_apply_record_to_page() makes the stream idempotent, exactly
 *	  as PG redo gates already-applied records on the on-disk page LSN.
 *
 *	  Corruption-critical contract (8.A).  Three gates before any write:
 *	    1. routing -- only cluster_smgr_which_for()==1 (genuinely shared user
 *	       relation) pages are touched; everything else (temp / catalog / opt-in
 *	       off) is a per-node concern the survivor owns -> data-pass skip.
 *	    2. existence (amend 1) -- a relation whose file is gone fails CLOSED, not
 *	       a BLK_NOTFOUND-style skip: 3a runs only the data-page apply matrix and
 *	       never the storage create/drop/truncate rmgr, so it cannot prove a
 *	       missing file is a legitimate drop.
 *	    3. range -- a block at/beyond EOF (relation extension / new init page)
 *	       fails CLOSED and forwards (Stage 5); the engine never reads past EOF.
 *	  Plus: any record the apply matrix cannot handle byte-for-byte (off-matrix
 *	  rmgr / unusable image) -> BLOCKED; a read error in-window -> BLOCKED; and
 *	  reaching clean end-of-WAL short of the validated scan_upper -> BLOCKED (the
 *	  WAL is incomplete; scan_upper is a durable boundary by precondition).
 *
 *	  SCOPE (increment 3a).  This engine ONLY writes shared pages.  It does NOT
 *	  publish authority, start a worker, unfreeze, or flush WAL.  smgrwrite is a
 *	  WRITE-BACK, not a durable write (cluster_fs write is a bare pwrite with no
 *	  inline fsync, amend 2); 3b must issue a durability barrier on the touched
 *	  relations BEFORE publishing any 3-way authority.  A crash before that
 *	  barrier simply re-replays from a validated lower bound (redo-idempotent via
 *	  the LSN-gate), since no authority was ever published.

 *	of the target block (D-h1/D-h3a), it is consumed as the recovery base
 *	instead of the live storage page: the record is judged by the ship-SCN
 *	boundary gate (lineage already in the PI bytes -> skip; first post-ship
 *	record -> write PI+record back and DISCARD the resident PI, after which
 *	the storage page carries the PI lineage with a dead-thread pd_lsn and
 *	every later record rides the normal LSN-gated path below).
 *	window_first_scn is the xl_scn of the FIRST record of this replay
 *	window (any block); the PI is only eligible when
 *	cluster_pi_recovery_gate(window_first_scn, ship_scn) == SKIP: per-thread
 *	xl_scn is non-decreasing in LSN order, so a lineage window-head proves
 *	every pre-window record is lineage too — i.e. the storage page's already-
 *	reflected history is contained in the PI's frozen bytes and the write-
 *	back can never regress shared storage.  Any doubt (no usable snapshot,
 *	judge failure, unusable stamp, apply failure) abandons the PI (discard,
 *	fail-safe) and falls back to the storage path — today's behaviour.
 * Why: the PI shortcut recovers the block without an FPI in the window and
 *	without depending on a stale storage base (the D-h3b differential t/349
 *	proves the byte-for-byte equivalence of this rebuild).
 *
 *	missing (spec-6.14 D9): non-NULL only on the visibility-enabled
 *	shared-catalog path; a missing-file block ref is then DEFERRED (recorded +
 *	skipped) instead of an immediate BLOCKED -- see ClusterThreadMissingRels.
