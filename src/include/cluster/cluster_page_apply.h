 *	  RF-PAGE PGDEL-06 — native apply admission, the §7.2 mutation
 *	  sequence gates, the §7.3 typed page proof, and the §7.6/§7.7
 *	  stable-base STOP + crash-matrix judgements.
 *
 *	  Spec: specs/spec-rf-page-crash-safe-page-replay-journal.md
 *	  §2.1 PGDEL-06 ("native buffer/GCS apply + durability + canonical
 *	  post-read；carrier STOP 不绕过"), §7 Apply, durability, post-read
 *	  and D3′, §11.1 G1/G1″/G3/G9.
 *
 *	  HARD CONTRACT (G1″/§7.6 — do not erase): this layer implements the
 *	  JUDGEMENTS of the §7 sequence.  The actual native buffer/GCS
 *	  authority, page write path, durability barrier and canonical
 *	  post-read are executed by the production caller under its own
 *	  serialization (the orchestrator/apply worker); nothing here mutates
 *	  a page, writes storage or touches authority.  The repeated-
 *	  recoverer mid-write cut stays RED: cluster_page_apply_midwrite_cut
 *	  always reports STABLE_BASE_UNRESOLVED (PL-03 / §7.6) — no approved
 *	  stable-base strategy exists, so a target-write crash can never be
 *	  papered over with SKIP, an expected-failure green or a mock carrier.
 *
 *	  NOT DELIVERED HERE (stays RED, later PGDEL items): the production
 *	  caller chain that fires every gate in the real orchestrator
 *	  (PGDEL-06 production wiring + PGDEL-07 proof handoff to RF-ROOT/
 *	  SIDE; §10.3 production-caller test), observability (PGDEL-08) and
 *	  the fault/acceptance TAP legs (PGDEL-09).
