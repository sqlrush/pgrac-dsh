 * cluster_startup_phase.h
 *	  pgrac cluster postmaster startup phase machinery (Stage 1.10
 *	  skeleton).
 *
 *	  Stage 1.10 introduces a state machine that splits the previously
 *	  single cluster_init() entry into Phase 0 (pre-shmem base) ->
 *	  Phase 1 (cluster basics: interconnect listener / heartbeat /
 *	  LMON) -> Phase 2 (lock services: LMS / LMD / LCK) -> Phase 3
 *	  (recovery: startup process / Recovery Coordinator / Workers) ->
 *	  Phase 4 (normal startup: walwriter / bgwriter / DIAG / Cluster
 *	  Stats) -> RUNNING.
 *
 *	  See docs/background-process-design.md §4 (canonical startup
 *	  order), specs/spec-1.10-postmaster-startup-phase-skeleton.md,
 *	  docs/postmaster-startup-phase-design.md.
 *
 *	  Five hard constraints (spec-1.10 §1.5):
 *	    HC1 PostmasterMain-only.  cluster_run_startup_sequence() must
 *	        be called from PostmasterMain function body, NOT from
 *	        inside CreateSharedMemoryAndSemaphores() (the latter also
 *	        runs in EXEC_BACKEND children).  Every entry function in
 *	        this file Assert(!IsUnderPostmaster).
 *	    HC2 enum SSOT.  ClusterStartupPhase is the single source of
 *	        truth.  The legacy cluster_phase const char * mirror is
 *	        read-only and updated only by cluster_advance_phase().
 *	        External code MUST NOT write cluster_phase = "...".
 *	    HC3 driver/handler split.  Phase handlers do work and return
 *	        PhaseRunResult.  The central driver loop in
 *	        cluster_run_startup_sequence() decides whether to advance
 *	        based on the result.  Phase handlers MUST NOT call
 *	        cluster_advance_phase() themselves.
 *	    HC4 timeout = FATAL.  Phase transition timeouts ereport(FATAL,
 *	        errcode PGRAC_E_PHASE_TRANSITION_TIMEOUT) so postmaster
 *	        startup fails cleanly.  GUC cluster.phase{1..4}_timeout is
 *	        actually read and enforced by the driver.  Stage 1.10 stub
 *	        does not naturally trigger timeouts; cluster-startup-phase-
 *	        N-enter inject point + sleep fault simulates a stuck phase
 *	        for regression coverage.
 *	    HC5 skeleton boundary.  1.10 spawns no new background processes
 *	        (1.11-1.14 each own their respective process spawn) and
 *	        does NOT implement restart strategy (postmaster FATAL is
 *	        handed off to external supervisor: systemd / launchd /
 *	        pg_ctl).  CLUSTER_PHASE_RECONFIG is reserved for Stage 6
 *	        feature-082 reconfig phase reentry; not in this enum yet.
