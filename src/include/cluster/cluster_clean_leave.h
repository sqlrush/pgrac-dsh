 * cluster_clean_leave.h
 *	  pgrac clean leave reconfiguration (spec-5.13) — cooperative
 *	  GES/GCS/PCM drain for a surviving node that leaves on purpose.
 *
 *	  spec-2.29 / 4.6 / 4.7 reconfiguration is all death-driven (a CSSD
 *	  DEAD edge → fence-close / failure-driven remaster).  This module
 *	  handles the dual case: a LIVE, cooperative node that leaves by plan.
 *	  Before it really exits it must actively drain everything it
 *	  holds/masters — GES grants, GRD master shards, PCM X locks, and dirty
 *	  GCS pages — to the surviving nodes, proving zero leftover holder /
 *	  waiter / dirty state / stale master, rather than "looking like a
 *	  crash".  If the drain cannot complete (the leaving node dies mid-drain
 *	  or the deadline expires) the path ESCALATES to fail-stop (spec-5.14):
 *	  clean leave never weakens fail-stop safety (CL-I7).
 *
 *	  soundness命门 (§0.3 / CL-I5): the leaving node holds PCM X on its
 *	  dirty blocks (exclusive → no survivor holds a conflicting current),
 *	  force-WAL-logs + FlushBuffers them to shared storage in its OWN
 *	  backend/checkpointer (never LMON, CL-I9), then releases X.  After that
 *	  no node's memory holds the current image, so shared-storage device
 *	  state is authoritative; survivors invalidate stale cache at leave-epoch
 *	  advance and read the just-flushed current via storage fallback.  This
 *	  sidesteps the Stage-6 cross-instance cache-coherence wall (53R9X)
 *	  WITHOUT shipping a cache image — but storage fallback for a leaving
 *	  block is allowed ONLY after it was flushed + the survivor invalidated
 *	  its cache; before that, fail-closed (CL-I5).
 *
 *	  Layering (mirrors the spec-5.11/5.12 policy split for unit-testability):
 *	    - cluster_clean_leave_policy.c : pure decision layer (phase-FSM
 *	      transition validity, writable-only quiesce gate, version-coherent
 *	      leave check, leave-intent marker structural validation).  No
 *	      PostgreSQL runtime dependency → exercised directly by cluster_unit.
 *	    - cluster_clean_leave.c : runtime driver (shmem state, the phase
 *	      state machine, voting-disk marker I/O, ProcSignal quiesce, IC
 *	      announce/ack, LMON orchestration, GES/GCS drain dispatch).
