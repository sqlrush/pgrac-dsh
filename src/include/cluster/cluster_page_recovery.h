 * cluster_page_recovery.h
 *	  RF-PAGE PGDEL-03 — exhaustive page/record class dispatcher, the
 *	  §3.5 per-block recovery state machine, and the §8.1 outcome
 *	  surface.
 *
 *	  Spec: specs/spec-rf-page-crash-safe-page-replay-journal.md
 *	  §2.1 PGDEL-03 ("exhaustive page/record class dispatcher；unknown
 *	  default 必须 BLOCKED"), §3.5 state machine, §4.1 recovery-action
 *	  column, §8.1 outcomes, §11.1 G9 (every promise lands as a RED-able
 *	  input/action/outcome).
 *
 *	  DELIVERED HERE:
 *	    - cluster_page_class_recovery_action: the §4.1 recovery-action
 *	      column as a closed class -> action table (every class has
 *	      exactly one action; UNKNOWN/WILLINIT-without-rule/NONLOGGED-
 *	      without-owner default BLOCKED);
 *	    - the §3.5 per-block state machine: strictly adjacent advance
 *	      only; a jump, repeat or terminal re-advance is rejected;
 *	      crash/restart always re-enters UNCLASSIFIED (D3′ — the
 *	      successor never reads a predecessor-private phase);
 *	    - cluster_page_dispatcher_verdict: classify + §3.2 decide ->
 *	      one §8.1 outcome; the class layer can only emit BLOCKED_CLASS
 *	      for the blocked branch — the SOURCE/CONTRIBUTOR/VERSION/AUTHORITY
 *	      subdivisions belong to the PGDEL-04..06 layers that own those
 *	      proofs.
 *
 *	  NOT DELIVERED HERE (stays RED, later PGDEL items): source
 *	  provenance (PGDEL-04), contributor closure (PGDEL-05), the
 *	  mutation/durability/post-read chain (PGDEL-06), observability
 *	  (PGDEL-08).  This layer performs no mutation, no I/O and no
 *	  authority interaction.
