 * cluster_page_handoff.h
 *	  RF-PAGE PGDEL-07 — per-resource page-proof handoff to RF-ROOT/
 *	  RF-SIDE with the §7.4 FND-10 retention judgement.
 *
 *	  Spec: specs/spec-rf-page-crash-safe-page-replay-journal.md
 *	  §2.1 PGDEL-07 ("per-resource proof handoff 给 RF-ROOT/SIDE；不创建
 *	  global barrier"), §7.3 page proof export, §7.4 FND-10 handoff,
 *	  §6.4 release scope.
 *
 *	  DELIVERED HERE:
 *	    - cluster_page_handoff_ready: the FND-10 conjunction for ONE
 *	      resource — the typed page proof (PGDEL-06) + the RF-SIDE proof
 *	      + the failed-origin retention interval still pinned + zero
 *	      remaining consumers.  Only when all four hold may the failed-
 *	      origin redo be retired for that interval; retaining redo never
 *	      by itself proves the torn target has a stable base (§7.4).
 *	    - cluster_page_handoff_retention_denied: the fail-closed answer
 *	      for a retire request that arrives before the PAGE proof exists
 *	      (PL-12: RF-ROOT denies removal).
 *
 *	  HARD CONTRACT (G1/G3 — do not erase): this layer judges the
 *	  handoff; the production wiring that actually delivers the proof to
 *	  the RF-ROOT/SIDE consumers (and the §10.3 production-caller test)
 *	  is the PGDEL-09/10 work.  The handoff is PER-RESOURCE: one block
 *	  ready never proves relation/thread/instance/WAL-interval readiness
 *	  (§6.4), and this API carries no global barrier state.
