 *	  RF-ROOT P9 audit #2 redo part 3 / DSH B′ cold-formation ruling
 *	  (2026-08-19): durable quorum-majority COLD-FORMATION marker —
 *	  the 5.22 "observation window + lowest co-boot arbiter writes a
 *	  durable formation marker" mixed design (spec-5.22-online-join-
 *	  cold-formation.md §8 Q1 A+C, frozen).
 *
 *	  A 2-node (or N-node) cluster that cold-co-boots PAST the initial
 *	  epoch (clean shutdown + restart, or a full-outage crash co-boot)
 *	  has no live survivor and no coordinator.  The co-booting nodes
 *	  observe a quorum-stable window with no fresh slot past INITIAL
 *	  (slot epoch semantics: an UN-FORMED node publishes INITIAL — see
 *	  cluster_qvotec.c), pick the LOWEST co-boot node as arbiter, and
 *	  the arbiter writes a COMMITTED formation marker naming the exact
 *	  formation generation / epoch / arbiter identity / co-boot member
 *	  incarnations to a quorum-majority of voting disks (region 7,
 *	  per-member slots, coordinator-write pattern of the JCMK region).
 *	  Every co-boot member then publishes record_admitted(exact
 *	  incarnation) -> exact equality -> MEMBER.  D13 strictness is
 *	  preserved: no presented carve-out, floors come only from the
 *	  marker (quorum-majority durable commit evidence, INV-J7/J8).
 *
 *	  Arbiter takeover (5.22 F2, frozen): the marker carries the arbiter
 *	  identity + incarnation; a crashed mid-formation arbiter's slot ages
 *	  out of the window, the next-lowest co-boot node re-observes, writes
 *	  a HIGHER formation_generation takeover marker (monotonic, CAS-on-
 *	  generation); no two arbiters can be co-equal at the same generation.
 *	  A new postmaster NEVER inherits a previous marker's incarnation —
 *	  it raises the formation generation and commits its CURRENT boot
 *	  incarnation (per-member, read from the voting slots).
 *
 *	  Live-cluster never-seen / returning nodes are NOT admitted here —
 *	  they keep the ordinary JCMK join path; the root never seeds
 *	  membership.
