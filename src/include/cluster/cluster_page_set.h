 *	  RF-PAGE PGDEL-05 — in-memory per-block recovery set builder and
 *	  the §6.3 contributor closure.
 *
 *	  Spec: specs/spec-rf-page-crash-safe-page-replay-journal.md
 *	  §2.1 PGDEL-05 ("in-memory per-block recovery-set builder 与
 *	  contributor closure；不是 persistent artifact"), §3.1
 *	  RedoPageChange, §3.3 shape-2 skip, §3.4 exact expected-before
 *	  adjacency, §6 per-block recovery set and conditional merge.
 *
 *	  DESIGN CONTRACT:
 *	    - BlockRecoverySet is a REBUILDABLE in-memory plan: it is not a
 *	      persistent artifact, not a successor authority, not a WAL
 *	      retirement certificate.  A recoverer crash discards it and the
 *	      successor rebuilds from canonical inputs (D3′, spec §6.1).
 *	    - The closure is a PURE judgement over the ordered contributor
 *	      list: same inputs always produce the same verdict (rerun
 *	      determinism, §6.3-9).
 *	    - Raw cross-thread LSN ordering is rejected: adjacency is exact
 *	      PageVersion equality only, and equal SCN with different
 *	      incarnation/identity is NOT adjacency (§3.4, §6.3, PU-27).
 *
 *	  NOT DELIVERED HERE (stays RED, later PGDEL items): the mutation/
 *	  durability/post-read chain (PGDEL-06) and the source census that
 *	  fills the recovery set from live CURRENT/PI/STORAGE (the caller
 *	  uses the PGDEL-04 validators + PGDEL-02 decode to build the
 *	  contributor list; the wiring into the production orchestrator is
 *	  PGDEL-06/07).
