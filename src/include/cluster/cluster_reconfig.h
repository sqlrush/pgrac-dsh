 *	  pgrac cluster reconfig coordinator — internal-only A scope
 *	  (spec-2.29).
 *
 *	  CSSD DEAD edge → LMON deterministic coordinator (min of survivor
 *	  set under Q2 A'' rule) → epoch++ → PROCSIG_CLUSTER_RECONFIG_START
 *	  broadcast to local backends → ProcessInterrupts re-check
 *	  cluster_qvotec_in_quorum + freeze flag → writable transactions
 *	  ereport 53R60 (or 53R50 if quorum lost).
 *
 *	  Sprint A Step 1 scope (this header):
 *	    - ReconfigEvent struct (8-field event metadata, 128-node
 *	      bitmap via uint8[16], cssd_dead_generation for P1.2 dedup)
 *	    - ClusterReconfigState shmem region (LWLock-guarded last
 *	      applied event + 3 atomic counters)
 *	    - 6 entry-point APIs: shmem_size/init/register/get_last_event
 *	      + broadcast_local_procsig (P1.3 split) +
 *	      apply_epoch_bump_as_coordinator + lmon_tick (Step 2 body)
 *	    - check_pending_in_proc_interrupts (Step 2 D4 ProcessInterrupts)
 *	    - publish_event (internal)
 *	    - CLUSTER_RECONFIG_DEAD_BITMAP_BYTES = 16 (128 nodes)
 *
 *	  Steps 2-7 add: lmon_tick body, ProcessInterrupts integration,
 *	  envelope verify path observe_remote (D20), SRF view 9 cols,
 *	  TAP 099 L1-L10, regress + manuals, catalog surface delta,
