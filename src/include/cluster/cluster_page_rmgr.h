 *	  RF-PAGE PGDEL-02 — applicable-redo rmgr census + PageVersion hints
 *	  decoder.
 *
 *	  Spec: specs/spec-rf-page-crash-safe-page-replay-journal.md
 *	  §2.1 PGDEL-02 ("applicable redo expected-before/result-version
 *	  producer + decoder；rmgr census 未实现"), §3.1 (SCN/LSN are
 *	  locator/hint only), §3.4 (the redo decoder must declare the
 *	  deterministic mutation under its class), §4.1 (the closed class
 *	  table), §11.1 G1/G3 (nothing here claims the existing replay path
 *	  is PageVersion-compliant).
 *
 *	  DELIVERED HERE:
 *	    - the rmgr census: every rmgr/opcode is either a census row
 *	      (page-affecting class assignment + byte-for-byte differential
 *	      evidence state) or explicitly unknown (fail-closed UNKNOWN);
 *	    - census -> classifier wiring: only rows with verified
 *	      byte-for-byte delta evidence (the existing t/256-differenced
 *	      apply matrix) register into the PGDEL-01 known-set, so the
 *	      closed classifier emits NORMAL exactly for those;
 *	    - cluster_page_redo_decode: extracts the PageIdentity from the
 *	      record's block reference and the §3.1 HINTS (xl_scn, record
 *	      LSN, FPI/WILL_INIT attributes) — explicitly NOT VersionTokens.
 *
 *	  NOT DELIVERED HERE (stays RED, later PGDEL items):
 *	    - the expected-before/result-version VersionToken producer
 *	      contract (needs the §3.1 producer/consumer census proof;
 *	      raw xl_scn/pd_block_scn must not be treated as VersionToken);
 *	    - deterministic-mutation declarations (decoder_registered is
 *	      false for every row — the §3.4 declaration belongs with the
 *	      apply chain, PGDEL-03/06);
 *	    - any mutation, durability, post-read or release.

 * One census row.  `rmid` + `opcode` identify the record (opcode is the
 * info byte after XLR_INFO_MASK); `opcode_mask` allows one row to cover a
 * family (0 = exact opcode match).  A row answers the §4.1 closed-table
 * questions without guessing:
 *
 *   affects_page   the record can carry a data-page block reference
 *                  (SLRU/relmap pages are page-affecting but HEADER-class
 *                  with a typed owner — never generic page replay).
 *   page_class     the §4.1 row the record belongs to when it affects a
 *                  page.
 *   known_delta    the (rmid, opcode) single-block delta passed the
 *                  byte-for-byte differential against PG real redo
 *                  (t/256 evidence; this is the ONLY row state that
 *                  registers into the PGDEL-01 classifier known-set).
 *   will_init      the record carries the full page re-initialization
 *                  semantic (heap XLOG_HEAP_INIT_PAGE).  This is an
 *                  ATTRIBUTE row fact, not a §4.6 full-init rule: the
 *                  exact expected class state + result-version proof
 *                  (the rule) is still RED (PU-17 stays UNKNOWN).
 *   decoder_registered  false for every row until the §3.4 deterministic-
 *                  mutation declaration + VersionToken producer contract
 *                  land with the apply chain (PGDEL-03/06).
